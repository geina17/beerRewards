### Sweat, then regret.
Users can determine how many calories they burned from a short list of common activities.
Then, the user can choose a beer type and learn how many beers they can drink to nullify their workout.
Additionally, they can search for events that match the activity of their choice to repeat the process and begin the cycle of meaningless exercise and self-reward.
